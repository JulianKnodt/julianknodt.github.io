# Teeth

Lately, I've been experiencing mild discomfort in my teeth, to put it lightly.
It's been rather frustrating, as it feels like anything I try at home hasn't been able to make
it better. I'm not sure if I'm doing anything wrong, but it's a pain in the mouth.

It's also made me reflect on what dentists do. There's preventative care, which essentially is
what you do at home but better. Ironically, my recent tooth troubles started after visiting a
dentist, and then later finding that some mouth pain was caused by food stuck in my mouth
before I went to the dentist. First, I'm not actually sure what varies between dentists. Do some
dentists just *look* better than others? Do they push certain procedures over others? How much
variance is there actually in dentists? I'd hope that it would be consistent, and any dentist I
go to could be good, but that's probably not the case. I just have very little idea how to
measure what a good dentist is, and I'm not sure whether I can test it or not.

What would be optimal for me would be if I could just heal my teeth at home. What I heard from
dentists though is that a toothbrush and floss can only reach so deep, so I guess that's not
possible with just those tools. I imagine tools that go deeper would be dangerous, but then it
would allow people to manage their teeth at home. I wonder whether anything for that has ever
been done.

Anyways, I hope my teeth feel better soon.
