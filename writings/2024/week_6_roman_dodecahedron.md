# Roman Dodecahedrons

Roman Dodecahedrons are dodecahedron's unearthed in a variety of places in Central Europe.

Their use to this day remains a mystery, but my guess is that their use is as a candle
holder. Since candle's likely came in a variety of sizes, and were much more difficult to
clean. To remove the residue from the bottom of the candle holder, it probably was much easier
to clean, especially since it isn't directly on the ground.
