# Seattle Chinatown

Being partially Cantonese, I often visit the Chinatown when I go to a new city.
Seeing as how there is a large Chinese population, I expected that it would be somewhat
thriving. Yea, no. Seattle's Chinatown is not bustling, and feels quite unsafe to be in at
times. It also has a few good restaurants, but for as large as it is, it lacks the character of
other chinatowns.

I think the main causes of this are primarily the location of Chinatown, and its streets. First,
it's sandwiched between a highway overpass, a hill, and train tracks for Amtrak and the local
light rail. This means that Chinatown has very little space to expand, and also occasionally
gets a somewhat unsavory crowd coming from Pioneer square and the light rail. Chinatown in
Seattle is effectively ``boxed in'', and thus it feels disjointed and cramped. For example,
there is a part of Chinatown beyond the highway overpass which I never go to, because you have
to walk underneath through 2 blocks worth of parking lot under the overpass to get there. That
feels like it stunted the growth of the Chinatown significantly.

Furthermore, the streets there are 3-5 cars wide (if I recall, it's an odd number due to middle
turning lanes). Thus, it's a bit difficult to walk through Chinatown. It doesn't feel
comfortable to cross the street except at the crosswalks, and thus it feels like there's much
less space to walk around, even though the streets are incredibly wide. There's no stop lights
either, just stop signs, which may be better since there is relatively little traffic in
Chinatown, but then if there's so little traffic the streets can be narrowed.

What I really want to see from Chinatown is that it's bustling with people. Right now, because
of safety, lack of a lot of things to do, and difficulty for kids and elderly to get around, I
think Seattle's Chinatown falls behind other ones I've been to in the US.
