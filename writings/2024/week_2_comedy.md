# Comedy

The only class I ever took that changed me was a comedy class in high school.
Taught by a crazy teacher, we learned that there's one easy to way to be funny:
be wild. Well no, what she said was reverse expectations.

If someone thinks you'll turn left, turn right. Being funny comes in two parts,
first building the expectation you'll do one thing, and then having the opposite occur.

Let's take slapstick comedy as an example. Replace every time someone gets hit with a bat or
punched, and imagine instead of bouncing back like a bobo the clown doll they just die. That's
not a comedy, that's a horror movie, everyone knows clowns are scary.

Everyone watching expects it to be painful, but at the same time slapstick comedy has lost some
of its charm because we've seen so much slapstick we _also_ expect it to be harmless. Thus, the
only funny slapstick comedy now mixes pain and not, putting the viewer in complete confusion
about what they're watching.

The most common western form of comedy is stand up, which is when someone stands and attempts to
make people sitting make noises without thinking about it. Usually, it comes in the form of a
story, which buids and builds, until a punchline, which kicks a listener's expected outcome (see
i.e. Trevor Noah, Dara O'Briain). Often I find that such comedy is a commentary on someone's
interaction with the world at large and why everything is shit (or not) and how they deal with
said shit.

Another form of comedy is manzai, or japanese double-act comedy. The way I would characterize it
is that there is an extremely rational person who will always make reasonable statements and
provide normal views, and one insane guy (see
[example](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Zp4y1S7gk/)). Of course, this makes it seem obvious
who will be spewing nonsense, but what makes 2 better than 1 is that we can look at our own
interactions and contrast it with theirs. There's so many wild, unexpected things someone else
can say, compared to riffing off your own monologue, like the more common western style. Because
it's a double act, I'd describe it as a commentary on our interaction with others, and the
craziness of people and not systems.
