Back in elementary school, we used to have a thing called the buddy program, where students in
1st to 3rd grade would be paired with a student from the 4th to 6th grade. For some reason, in
1st to 3rd grade I was paired with special eds students, which did a number to my brain at the
time. I assumed it was because I was somehow like them, and it made me quite upset because while
all the other students could have fun, it was really hard for me to know what to do with my
buddy. Recently, I was told that teachers thought I was way more patient, which is likely why
this happened. Would've been good to know at the time.

When I was around 12, I did an exchange program to Tsuchiura in Japan. For one day, I went to a
local middle school and sat in on classes, including an English class. In that English class,
they asked me to read from an English book for the other students. Of course, I did so, and to
my surprise, realized that the book was on the American bombing of Hiroshima. Later on that same
trip, we went to the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum, from which I do not remember much other
than melting bodies on the floor. From time to time though, I remember realizing that I, an
American, was reading to many other people about how we had bombed them, and I still am not sure
what to make of that experience.

On that same trip, we went to a temple and had to hold the lotus position for 30 minutes, and I
swear that's where the start of my knee problems began.

In Seattle, there was someone I had known who maintained a tier-list of his friends, based on
how hard they tried at each event he hosted. He also charged people per event, with some profit
margin. There's some crazy people out there.

Going to Korea for half a year was likely one of the best decisions I've made, in terms of the
way people live their life and treat other people. At the same time,
it's given me a reference point to compare America against. I hope someday some of the nice
parts of Korea will arrive here.
