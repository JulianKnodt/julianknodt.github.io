# How do you score a mango?
## So that it folds as much as possible with as few cuts as possible

It's been a while since I've written anything, as I've not had anything important to write
about, but today I've found an important thing to write about.

How do you score a mango, with as few cuts as possible, such that it is able to invert as much
as possible?

I recently bought 30 mangoes, and have thus been eating a steady stream of juicy goodness. To
eat mangos, I use the [standard
technique](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/how-to-cut-a-mango) of scoring them and
flipping them inside out. As I've done this over 20 times, I started to wonder how few times I
could cut the mango before flipping it out. The standard scoring is usually done in a perfect
grid, and doesn't care about the shape of the mango. After trying out random cutting, I realized
this required a lot of cuts, which means that there are many small mango chunks, and I prefer to
have larger pieces for the _perfect mouthfeel_ ðŸ¤ª.

We can assume the classic physics assumption, a [mango is half a
cylinder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_cow). In the mental mango model, the mango
meat is perfectly solid and is not allowed to bend. The impact this has is that we can only fold
exactly along where we cut. From this rule, I believe the first optimal cut is then down the
cylindrical side of the mango, so that it can be folded first along this cut. From there we can
continually alternate directions, cutting halfway through each cut region. In essence, it's
continually splitting the mango in halves, which will lead to the largest chunks in the end,

When we stop assuming that the mango is a cylinder though, how might we go about scoring it? Can
we assume that we are able to fold the mango along slightly curved scores? Do non-parallel cuts
make the pieces less desirable when eating it? These mango questions haunt me, and as I eat
another 10 mangos I will reflect more on carving them.
