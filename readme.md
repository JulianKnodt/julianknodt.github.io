Hey, these are just random thoughts or opinions I have.
If you have any comments or questions on what to write about or questions, go to the [github repo][github
repo] for this page, and file an issue, or make a pull request! I'll get to 'em eventually.

- [Random Sparsity Pattern Ideas](sparsity_patterns.md)
  - Exploration of idea for sparsity in matrices, random thoughts.

- [Unrealistic Algorithmic Analysis](unrealistic_algorithmic_analysis.md)
  - I'm a bit disappointed in how big `O` analysis is often not useful, because it ends up
    ignoring the architecture of computers and how data caches work. This is a rant about how
    there may be more feasible ways to measure complexity, by keeping costs of different
    operations such as arithmetic/memory accesses separate.

- [Useless blog posts](useless_blogs.md)
  - A meta blog post about blog posts which have no meaning, i.e. the 10th blog to explain
    React.

- [Ink Renderer](http://ink-renderer.herokuapp.com/)
  - [Github](https://github.com/JulianKnodt/gfx-final-project)
  - Final Project for [graphics](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spring20/cos426/)
- [Square Heap](https://github.com/JulianKnodt/sqr_heap)
  - An experiment with modifying the number of children for a heap. See readme for more info
- [Mireba](https://github.com/JulianKnodt/mireba)
  - A photorealistic raytracer based on [Mitsuba](https://www.mitsuba-renderer.org/). WIP.
- [quick maths](https://github.com/JulianKnodt/quick_maths)
  - A simple math library for use with mireba. Hopefully I can continue to upgrade to be more
    full-fledged for general purpose use but right now it's designed for graphics.
- [Mat-FST](https://github.com/JulianKnodt/mat-fst)
  - An experiment for using [Finite State Transducers](https://github.com/BurntSushi/fst) as
    sparse matrices. Check out the readme for more info.
- [Small-SAT](https://github.com/JulianKnodt/small_sat)
  - A concurrent SAT solver based on MiniSAT. Exploring the idea of having multiple threads, but
    would've been a lot better if I had known Rust better at the time. Still learned a lot from
    it though.
- [artPanel](https://github.com/JulianKnodt/artPanel)
  - A fun CLI util to render images in terminal with color. If you're in terminal all the time
    and find it bland you can run this in the background to lighten things up.
