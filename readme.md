Hey, I'm a programmer who is interested in a myriad number of things!
I'm broadly interested in graphics (physically based rendering), compilers (Rust!),
operating systems, and how people interact with social networks. I also dabble in
machine learning, when it's small enough to run on my 2010 GPU.

Outside of programming, I _try to_ spend my time learning about philosophy (specifically
ethics), attempting to cook and bake, taking stupidly long walks around my neighborhood, and
fencing. I'm still exploring what it's like to be free from the shackles of school, so I'm
exploring many new activities ðŸ™‡.

If you're looking to collaborate on something, want to get coffee/tea, or are just generally
interested in chatting, email me! I'm all over the place, but am currently near Seattle for a
brief stint, but am usually in the Bay Area.

If you have any comments or questions on my writing, go to the [github repo][github repo] for
this page, and file an issue, or make a pull request! I'll get to 'em eventually.

- [Random Sparsity Pattern Ideas](sparsity_patterns.md)
  - Exploration of idea for sparsity in matrices, random thoughts.

- [Unrealistic Algorithmic Analysis](unrealistic_algorithmic_analysis.md)
  - I'm a bit disappointed in how big `O` analysis is often not useful, because it ends up
    ignoring the architecture of computers and how data caches work. This is a rant about how
    there may be more feasible ways to measure complexity, by keeping costs of different
    operations such as arithmetic/memory accesses separate.

- [Useless blog posts](useless_blogs.md)
  - A meta blog post about blog posts which have no meaning, i.e. the 10th blog to explain
    React.

- [Ink Renderer](http://ink-renderer.herokuapp.com/)
  - [Github](https://github.com/JulianKnodt/gfx-final-project)
  - Final Project for [graphics](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spring20/cos426/)
- [Square Heap](https://github.com/JulianKnodt/sqr_heap)
  - An experiment with modifying the number of children for a heap. See readme for more info
- [Mireba](https://github.com/JulianKnodt/mireba)
  - A photorealistic raytracer based on [Mitsuba](https://www.mitsuba-renderer.org/). WIP.
- [quick maths](https://github.com/JulianKnodt/quick_maths)
  - A simple math library for use with mireba. Hopefully I can continue to upgrade to be more
    full-fledged for general purpose use but right now it's designed for graphics.
- [Mat-FST](https://github.com/JulianKnodt/mat-fst)
  - An experiment for using [Finite State Transducers](https://github.com/BurntSushi/fst) as
    sparse matrices. Check out the readme for more info.
- [Small-SAT](https://github.com/JulianKnodt/small_sat)
  - A concurrent SAT solver based on MiniSAT. Exploring the idea of having multiple threads, but
    would've been a lot better if I had known Rust better at the time. Still learned a lot from
    it though.
- [artPanel](https://github.com/JulianKnodt/artPanel)
  - A fun CLI util to render images in terminal with color. If you're in terminal all the time
    and find it bland you can run this in the background to lighten things up.

## Games

I'm trying to get into making my own little games using
[Pico-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php), which is a fantastic little game maker and way
to run games. I've had moderate success, but will share what I make here!

- [Starmine](https://julianknodt.github.io/starmine.html)
  - A space shooter resource gathering game

## Work History

For those interested in hiring me,
I've worked at a variety of places, on system software,
and am mostly interested in backend/low-level software or research!



<details>
<summary>Where I've worked:</summary>

<div markdown="1">

##### Internships:

Winter thru Summer '17: [Brigade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brigade_Media)
  - Android Development (Kotlin) & GraphQL (Node) + Ruby on Rails

Summer '18: Paypal
  - GraphQL (Node)

Summer '19: Google
  - Testing liveliness of servers (Golang)

Summer '21: [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/)
  - Add new port mapping protocols, Routing Server metrics (Golang)
  - See commits [here](https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Ajulianknodt)
</div>

</details>

##### Research:

While the line between research and normal programming can be blurry, there are some things
which are clearly research. While these are definitely "research", usually I find just messing
around with code can be close to research in its own way.

Summer '20: [Princeton Computational Imaging Lab](https://light.princeton.edu/)
  - Mitsuba implement time of flight gating (C++)

[Arxiv!](https://arxiv.org/search/?query=julian+knodt&searchtype=all&source=header)

<!-- TODO list papers individually -->


## Other Stuff

I also have been keeping a playlist for 7 years! This is the accumulation of some of the music
I've been listening to since the end of high-school, and it at times reflects the emotions I
felt while living my life. In that way, I consider it a summary of how I've felt over the past 7
years, so I hope that while listening to it, you can experience some of what I've felt.
